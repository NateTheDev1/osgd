# Contribution Guide

All content outside of the published changes must be reviewed and corrected until proven ready to distribute. Read below for more details on contributions to the OSGD content catalog.

## Micro-Topics

Contributors are able to create micro-topics on things such as localization or favorable architectural designs. Micro-topics will be added over time by both myself and reviewed topics will be added from the community to learn more specific topics outside of the main course.

When opening a pull request please include all information needed for approval. Mark your pull request with a **WIP:** prefixing the title if it is not ready for review. If it is ready for review please prefix the title with **RN** for `review needed`. Pull requests without title prefixes will not be considered and removed after 1 month if no contact or activity is suggested.

### General Guidelines

Please consider the following when submitting a pull request

- The content is educational and productive to the game development pathway.
- The content is specified whether or not it is made by yourself.
- If the content is paid, you tried your best to include free alternatives
- This **is not** to earn money so soliciting your own paid information is not allowed unless explicitly requested in the description.
