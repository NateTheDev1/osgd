# Summary

I have been programming, building computers, and making games since I was 11 years old. The thing about starting so young is that the only thing you have is the internet; the internet is a powerful thing. Many people don't have the opportunity to attend college or earn a certification and finding the right resources or learning tools online can be overwhelimg or elusive to find. What OSGD aims to do is provide a **complete pathway to becoming a modern game developer**.

The provided curriculum is maintained by myself for now however anyone is free to contribute their information on micro-topics that will be reviewed and potentially be added to the pathway.

The main course content will be organized by difficulty level and include a variety of resources to suit many different learning styles such as:

- _Books_
- _Courses_
- _Videos_

_The resources are out there, it's my job to find them and present them to you._

To contribute to the content please visit the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Quality Assurance

All content descrived here is reviewed by myself and like-minded individuals to ensure the content is of the best quality and useful enough to be added to the pathwa.

The main qualifying topics originate from top colleges and art schools around the United States. Using the syllabi we are able to transpile what topics are important and what modern schools are teaching right now.

## Micro-Topics

As mentioned above, contributors are able to create micro-topics on things such as localization or favorable architectural designs. Micro-topics will be added over time by both myself and reviewed topics will be added from the community to learn more specific topics outside of the main course.
